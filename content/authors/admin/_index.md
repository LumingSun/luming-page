Luming Sun receieved his PhD degree from Renmin University of China, under the supervision of professor [Cuiping Li](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/jsky/szdw/ajxjgcx/jsjkxyjsx1/js2/aebd5e3b1cfa45f185229034e905ed57.htm). His area of research is artificial intelligence for systems (AI4Sys), and he is particularly interested in providing traditional database systems with practical and reliable machine learning techniques for better performance (AI4DB). He maintains a paper list ([ML4DB-paper-list](https://github.com/LumingSun/ML4DB-paper-list)) about the topic for people who might be interested in.
<!-- Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
