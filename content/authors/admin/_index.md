Luming Sun receieved his PhD degree from School of Information, Renmin University of China. His area of research is artificial intelligence for systems (AI4Sys), and he is particularly interested in providing traditional database systems with practical and reliable machine learning techniques for better performance (AI4DB). He maintains a paper list ([ML4DB-paper-list](https://github.com/LumingSun/ML4DB-paper-list)) about the topic for people who might be interested in. Right now, he is concentrating on query optimization with learning methods.
